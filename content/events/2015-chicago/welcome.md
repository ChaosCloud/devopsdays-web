<h2>Tuesday, August 25th and Wednesday, August 26th</h2>

Welcome! The group that brought you DevOpsDays Chicago 2014 is back together and planning the 2015 event. We're encouraged by the feedback from last year's event and are determined to bring an improved experience and continue the DevOps conversation this August in Chicago.
